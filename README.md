# calories-follow

This will be a calorie tracking project developed in React. It will utilize a food API to fetch nutritional and calorie information for consumed foods. The goal is to facilitate the tracking of calories consumed and store the data on a monthly basis.

### What problem does this project solve?

The project I want/will be working on aims to address this issue by providing a free and personalized platform for recording and calculating consumed calories. The goal is to offer you the freedom to choose from a comprehensive database of food items, including prepared foods, without having to pay for a premium subscription.
I've been using calorie tracking apps myself, and I know how important it is to have the flexibility to accurately track your intake, whether it's a homemade meal or a packaged snack. With this project, I aim to create a solution that puts you in control of your calorie tracking journey. No more limitations or paywalls, just a lightweight and user-friendly platform designed to support your progress.

### Goals:

- Utilize a food API to search for and retrieve nutritional and calorie information for foods.
- Create a calorie counter where users can add consumed foods and automatically calculate the total calories.
- Store calorie consumption data on a monthly basis.

### Technical breakdown:
The project will use React as the web development framework, leveraging reusable components and efficient rendering. It will integrate a food API to obtain the necessary nutritional information for calorie tracking.
For data storage, a cloud-based database like Firebase Firestore or MongoDB Atlas can be utilized to store the calorie consumption data on a monthly basis. This will allow users to have organized tracking of their calorie intake and access the data at any time.
