# calories-follow

This will be a calorie tracking project developed in React. It will utilize a food API to fetch nutritional and calorie information for consumed foods. The goal is to facilitate the tracking of calories consumed and store the data on a monthly basis.

# What problem does this project solve?
Tracking consumed calories can be complicated and requires consistent management. Currently, there are not many options that offer personalized tracking without relying on social media accounts. This project will address this problem by providing a lightweight and user-friendly platform for recording and calculating calories consumed, while also storing the data on a monthly basis for better organization.

# Goals:

Utilize a food API to search for and retrieve nutritional and calorie information for foods.
Create a calorie counter where users can add consumed foods and automatically calculate the total calories.
Store calorie consumption data on a monthly basis.
Technical breakdown:
The project will use React as the web development framework, leveraging reusable components and efficient rendering. It will integrate a food API to obtain the necessary nutritional information for calorie tracking.

For data storage, a cloud-based database like Firebase Firestore or MongoDB Atlas can be utilized to store the calorie consumption data on a monthly basis. This will allow users to have organized tracking of their calorie intake and access the data at any time
